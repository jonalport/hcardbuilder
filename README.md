# hcardbuilder
A simple hCard builder, made with React &amp; Webpack

Functionality includes:
 - Live updating hCard as you type
 - You can see an image preview if you select an image

The "Create" button doesn't actually do anything.

To get this running on your own machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:jonalport/hcardbuilder.git
cd hcardbuilder
npm install
npm start
```

You should now have a webpack dev server running at:

http://localhost:8080
