# hcardbuilder
A simple hCard builder, made with React &amp; Webpack.

[View the demo](http://jonalport.github.io/hcardbuilder/)

## Functionality
 - Live updating hCard as you type
 - You can see an image preview if you select an image

The "Create" button doesn't actually do anything.

## Getting it running

```
git clone git@github.com:jonalport/hcardbuilder.git
cd hcardbuilder
npm install
npm start
```

You should now have a webpack dev server running at:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```
